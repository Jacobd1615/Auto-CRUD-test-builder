# Auto CRUD Tester 🚀

**Empowering Junior Developers with Automated Testing**
## 🎯 Purpose

This tool was created specifically for **junior developers** who need to:
- Learn testing best practices without the initial complexity
- Focus on building features instead of writing test boilerplate
- Understand how proper CRUD testing should look
- Build confidence in their testing approach
- Get started with testing immediately on any project

## ✨ What This Tool Does

🔍 **Smart Schema Discovery**: Automatically analyzes your database structure
📝 **Test Generation**: Creates comprehensive CRUD tests for all your tables
🧪 **Data Generation**: Produces realistic test data based on your schema
🔐 **Login Testing**: Generates authentication and authorization tests
📊 **Clear Reports**: Provides easy-to-understand test results
🎓 **Learning Tool**: Shows junior devs what good tests look like

## 🎓 Perfect For Junior Developers Because...

## 🚀 Quick Start for Junior Devs

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd auto_tester
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your Database
Edit `config/db_config.yaml` with your database details:
```yaml
postgresql:
  host: localhost
  database: your_project_db
  user: your_username
  password: your_password
```

### 3. Generate Tests
```bash
python main.py
```

That's it! Your tests are ready to run.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By using this tool, junior developers will understand:
- How to structure test files
- What makes a good test case
- How to test database operations safely
- Best practices for test data management
- How to read and interpret test results

## 🛠️ Features Designed for Learning

### Automatic Test Generation
- **CREATE tests**: Validates data insertion
- **READ tests**: Checks data retrieval and filtering
- **UPDATE tests**: Ensures data modification works correctly
- **DELETE tests**: Verifies data removal and constraints

### Smart Data Generation
- Realistic test data based on your schema
- Edge cases automatically included
- Foreign key relationships respected
- Data types properly handled

### Clear Test Reports
